>>>> Model Building:

        * Loads the pre-trained model without its top classification layer.

        * Adds a new classification head with a Global Average Pooling layer followed by Dense layers.

        * Creates the full model and compiles it using an optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

>>>> Data Preparation:

        * Defines paths to the train, validation, and test data directories.

        * Sets image dimensions and defines data augmentation strategies for training and validation data using ImageDataGenerator.

        * Creates data generators for training, validation, and test data.

>>>> Model Training:

        * Fits the model to the training data using the fit method, specifying the training and validation data generators.

>>>> Model Evaluation:

        * Evaluates the trained model on the test data using the evaluate method and prints the test accuracy.

>>>> Confusion Matrix Visualization:

        * Generates predictions on the test data and calculates the confusion matrix.

        * Visualizes the confusion matrix using matplotlib.

        * Calculates and prints sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) from the confusion matrix.
